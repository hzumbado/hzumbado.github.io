I am interested in quantifying how environmental threats (e.g., pathogens, invasive species, climate change, and habitat deterioration) drive the distribution of native species in different spatial scales. I am also interested in identifying the environmental factors (biotic and abiotic) that constrain, partially or totally, the negative effect of threats on endangered species. For this, I use a combination of spatial analyses, geographic information systems, and ecological niche modeling.
