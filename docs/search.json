    "text": "I am interested in quantifying how environmental threats (e.g., pathogens, invasive species, climate change, and habitat deterioration) drive the distribution of native species in different spatiotemporal scales. I am also interested in identifying the environmental factors (biotic and abiotic) that constrain, partially or totally, the negative effect of threats on endangered species. For this, I use a combination of spatial analyses, geographic information systems, and niche modeling."

    "text": "During my career, I have worked on conservation projects for multiple taxa, especially freshwater and terrestrial communities with the aim of developing management plans for threatened species at the regional and local levels. My research methods follow strict scientific design and center on testable hypotheses analized through a combination of spatial analyses, multivariate statistics, and geographic information systems.\nI have dedicated most of my reserch, especially during grad school to the study of host-pathogen dynamics in amphibian communities. I mainly examined the effect of the chytrid pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in the distribution of amphibians in the Tropics of Central America. In the last years, I have worked on examining present and predicted future geographic distributions of invasive and native species of multiple taxa. I have also invested time in learning proficient tools to improve data wrangling and visualition, and code reproducibility."

Lynn Sweet and Darrell Jenerette, I am evaluatig the current and future distribution of perennial desert plants in the Coachella Valley and neighboring areas in Southern California under several scenarios of future climate change. The main aims of this project are 1) to identify current hotspots of carbon production storage, 2) identify biological interactions among community members, and 3) predict changes in the community composition of desert plants in the lower sections of the Coachella Valley. Furthermore, this project offers a strong focus on conservation outreach to local communities."

The goal of the project is to refine ongoing surveillance programs and guide regulatory response in the event that one or more of these invasive moths are introduced into the Western US. My research activities include a combination of species distribution modeling, network analysis of invasion pathways and regional patterns of spread, and simulation modeling of trapping network efficacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlarvae of EGVM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadult of EGVM\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana"
