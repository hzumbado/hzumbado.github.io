    "text": "I am interested in quantifying how environmental threats (e.g., pathogens, invasive species, climate change, and habitat deterioration) drive the distribution of native species in different spatiotemporal scales. I am also interested in identifying the environmental factors (biotic and abiotic) that constrain, partially or totally, the negative effect of threats on endangered species. For this, I use a combination of spatial analyses, geographic information systems, and niche modeling."

    "text": "During my studies, I have worked on conservation projects for multiple taxa, especially freshwater and terrestrial communities. I have dedicated most of my reserch, especially during grad school to the study of host-pathogen dynamics in amphibian communities. I mainly examined the effect of the chytrid pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in the distribution of ammphibians in the Tropics of Central America. However, my methods can be used on different taxa and the results of my studies have been used to develop management plans for threatened species at the regional and local levels."
